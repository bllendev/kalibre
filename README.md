**ebook management software**

**author**: Allen Garza

Hello! Welcome to Kalibre! This is a django web app which gives users a convenient place to send ebooks to whatever emails they please (including to straight to their kindles!). It will allow users to see a history of their previous book searches, a history of the books they've sent to themselves, and allows users to translate the books they send to themselves as they please. Kalibre uses several open repositories such as Libgen, Project Gutenberg, Archvix, and Petrucci Music Library.

Kalibre also offers a helpful AI Librarian named Kalibre, who can help users discern what their looking for and help find and send the book or document they wish to send to themselves.


As of now the site is live and completely functional!
