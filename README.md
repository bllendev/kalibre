Hello! Welcome to Kalibre! This is a home-made web app which uses Libgen and gives users a convenient place to send
ebooks to whatever emails they please (including to straight to their kindles!).

The following is a personal project that I'm hoping to make public in the next few months as I continue to develop.

As of now the site is live and completely functional!
