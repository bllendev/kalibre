{% comment %} It'd be cool if this page had a review bucket to see whats in your 'cart' of books you want to send yourself,
on the cart you chose what file type you want for each, and also you could pick and choose which emails you want to
use and send those books too.

One of the emails should be the highest priority email, and a highest priority file type too, then if the user just wants to quick send
to a single place they can. {% endcomment %}
